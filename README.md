mp3-crawller
============

a python crawler that searches the web for mp3 files based on keywords.

This is a crawler written in python the crawls specifics websites based 
on the given keywords and downloads matching files.

This is an app I intend to develop further as a learning experience for making 
better crawlers.


[NOTE: This app is strictly for learning purposes and it should not be used to
download any sort of music without the distributors permission or in any way that 
is termed illegal. If you wish to do that, I ask you to not use this application.]
